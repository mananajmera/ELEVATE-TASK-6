# Password Strength Evaluation Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate how password complexity affects security. This includes creating various passwords with different characteristics, testing them using an online password strength checker, analyzing the results, and identifying the best practices for secure password creation.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Password Creation

Multiple passwords were created with intentional variation in the following factors:

- Length (short, medium, long)
- Use of:
  - Uppercase letters (A‚ÄìZ)
  - Lowercase letters (a‚Äìz)
  - Numbers (0‚Äì9)
  - Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)

### 2. Password Strength Testing

Passwords were evaluated using [The Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/), a tool that rates password strength based on several criteria like length, character diversity, and placement.

### 3. Results and Observations

#### ‚úÖ Example 1 ‚Äì **Very Strong Password (100%)**

- Length: 17 characters
- Included uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Achieved full score: **100%**
- Feedback: Balanced composition and good use of varied characters

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Example 2 ‚Äì **Very Weak Password (16%)**

- Length: 15 characters
- Used only lowercase letters (no diversity)
- Score: **16%**
- Feedback: Failed to include uppercase, numbers, or symbols

## Best Practices Identified

- Use passwords **12+ characters** in length
- Include a **mix of character types**:
  - Uppercase and lowercase
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Avoid repeating characters or common patterns
- Use **unpredictable combinations** (not dictionary words)

---

## Tips Learned from Evaluation

- Longer passwords significantly increase strength
- Even long passwords are weak if character diversity is poor
- Placing symbols/numbers in the middle improves score
- Meeting at least **3 of 4 key requirements** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) is essential

---

## Research: Common Password Attacks

### üîì Brute Force Attack
- Attempts every possible combination
- More effective against short/simple passwords
- Complexity and length drastically increase resistance

### üìö Dictionary Attack
- Uses a list of common passwords/words
- Easily defeats weak passwords like "password123" or "qwerty"

---

## Summary: Password Complexity and Security

Password strength increases dramatically with higher complexity and length. Based on tests:

- **Strong passwords** resist both brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Using password managers is recommended to manage complex, unique credentials.
- Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts.

---

## Conclusion

Testing various passwords highlights the importance of thoughtful password creation. By incorporating length and complexity, users can dramatically improve their cybersecurity posture.
